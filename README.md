# Development platforms
### Visual Studio Code
Versatile platform which enables code development across multiple languages.

### Gitpod
Enables small online instances to be set up, where instances of visual studio code can be run

Lots of benefits:
- Unique instances mean that there's a reduced chance of errors associated with python kernels, libraries etc
- Gitpod instances for individual github repos - helps with managing git for projects without any terminal interaction required
